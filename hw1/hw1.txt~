Purpose: Creating step by step algorithms of given problems

1.)

1.Start at party entrance
2.Input Student ID into narrow-necked urn if you have one. Else give up.
3.Enter through the door
4.Party and then leave
5.Grab narrow-necked urn
6.Turn narrow-necked urn upside down
7.Shake urn until random Student ID drops
8.Grab one random Student ID
9.Check Student ID if it is yours
10.If yours, leave, else continue to line 11
11.Look for student not paired with anyone else
12.Talk to student and check both Student ID if it matches the user or student
13.If User or Student ID match either person, trade Student IDs
14.Go to line 9.


2.)

1.Set a to number of digits in number (int)
2.Set product to zero
3.Input base 12 number
4.Multiply the first digit by 12 to the power of a and add to product
5.Multiply the next number by 12 to the power of a minus one and add to product
6.Go to line 4 until a is less than zero
7.Output base 10 with product result


3.)

1.Assign letters to numeric value
2.Input two words
3.Check first letter of both words if they are different, if so, continue to
line 6.
4.Check the next letter on both words, if next letter character is unapplicable, assign null
and continue to line 7.
5.If the letter values are different, continue to line 6, else go to line 4.
6.Subtract the lowest numeric value from the highest numeric value of the two letters.
7.Output and print: HighestLetter(value)-LowestLetter(value)= Result
